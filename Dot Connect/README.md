# Dot Connect Game

## Overview

This JavaScript file implements the backend logic for a Dot Connect game. The game involves two players taking turns to drop colored chips into a grid. The objective is to connect four chips of the same color either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

## Features

- **Player Management**: Tracks the current player's turn and switches between players after each move.
- **Game Board**: Manages the state of the game board, allowing chips to be dropped and updating the board accordingly.
- **Win Detection**: Detects when a player has connected four chips of the same color and declares the winner.
- **Reset Functionality**: Allows players to reset the game board and start a new game.
