# Projects

Welcome to the Projects repository!

## Overview

Join me on a coding adventure as I tackle daily mini-projects across various programming languages. From Python to JavaScript and beyond, explore a diverse range of projects and follow along with my coding journey.

## Breakdown

## How to Navigate

Each project is organized into its own folder within this repository. Here's what you'll find inside each project folder:
